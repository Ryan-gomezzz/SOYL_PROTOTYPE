# feat(3d-studio): interactive 3D design studio (viewer, voice + save/export)

## Summary

This PR introduces a complete 3D design studio feature for SOYL, enabling users to preview garments in 3D with real-time customization, voice commands, and save/export functionality. The implementation focuses on manual controls and robust UI for the MVP, with AI generation intentionally out of scope.

## What Changed

### Frontend
- **New ThreeViewer Component**: Full-featured 3D viewer using Three.js with:
  - GLTFLoader for model loading with fallback cube
  - OrbitControls for intuitive camera manipulation
  - Material system supporting colors and textures
  - Real-time rendering with GPU acceleration
  - Model info display (vertices, triangles)

- **InspectorPanel Component**: Comprehensive control panel with:
  - HTML5 color picker with hex display
  - Texture selector with visual previews
  - Camera view presets (front, back, left, right, top, reset)
  - Scale and rotation sliders
  - Save and export buttons with loading states

- **VoiceController Component**: Web Speech API integration with:
  - Start/stop listening toggle
  - Command parsing for rotation, zoom, color, texture, views
  - Visual transcript and confirmation
  - Graceful fallback for unsupported browsers
  - Accessibility support

- **DesignStudio3D Page**: Main page integrating all components with:
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Notification toast system
  - Loading overlay
  - Keyboard shortcuts (arrows, +/-, R)
  - Help panel with controls and voice commands

- **useScreenshot Hook**: Canvas capture utility for export functionality

### Backend
- **API Routes** (`/api/designs`):
  - `POST /save` - Save design with optional thumbnail
  - `GET /:id` - Retrieve design by ID
  - `GET /` - List designs with pagination
  - `POST /export` - Export design as PNG
  - `DELETE /:id` - Delete design

- **LocalStore Abstraction**: Storage layer with:
  - File system storage for MVP
  - S3-ready interface for future migration
  - Base64 image handling
  - Pagination support
  - Error handling

- **Server Updates**:
  - CORS middleware
  - Static file serving for uploads
  - 50MB JSON limit for base64 images
  - Error handling middleware

### Assets
- Placeholder model directory with setup README
- Sample texture directory with download instructions
- Fallback cube geometry when model is missing

### Tests
- Comprehensive API tests using supertest:
  - Save/load/list/delete/export endpoints
  - LocalStore functionality
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Pagination testing
  - Image upload validation

### Documentation
- Complete feature README (`src/features/3d-studio/README.md`) with:
  - Installation and setup instructions
  - Usage guide with controls and voice commands
  - API endpoint documentation with examples
  - Architecture overview
  - Model and texture addition guide
  - S3 configuration instructions
  - Browser compatibility matrix
  - Accessibility features
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Performance optimization tips

## How to Test Locally

1. **Checkout the branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/3d-studio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/server
   npm run dev:express
   ```

4. **Start the frontend (in another terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd packages/app
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Navigate to the 3D studio:**
   Open `http://localhost:5173/design-studio-3d`

6. **Test features:**
   - **3D Viewer**: Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click to pan
   - **Color Picker**: Click color input and choose a color
   - **Textures**: Click texture options (will show fallback colors without images)
   - **View Presets**: Click Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, Reset buttons
   - **Sliders**: Adjust scale and rotation
   - **Voice Commands**: Click microphone button (Chrome/Edge only) and say:
     - "Rotate left"
     - "Zoom in"
     - "Make it red"
     - "Front view"
     - "Save design"
   - **Save**: Click "Save Design" button (check browser console for response)
   - **Export**: Click "Export PNG" button (downloads image)
   - **Keyboard**: Use arrow keys, +/-, and R key

7. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/server
   npm test
   ```

## Notes & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- **No 3D Model Included**: Users need to add their own GLB file to `/public/models/placeholder.glb`
  - Download free models from Sketchfab or create in Blender
  - See `/public/models/README.md` for instructions

- **No Texture Images**: Texture selector shows fallback colors
  - Add JPG/PNG files to `/public/textures/`
  - See `/public/textures/README.md` for sources

- **Voice Commands Browser Support**: 
  - ✅ Chrome, Edge (full support)
  - ⚠️ Safari (limited)
  - ❌ Firefox (not supported)

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Replace placeholder.glb with real garment models
- [ ] Add actual fabric texture images
- [ ] Integrate with S3 for cloud storage
- [ ] Add user authentication and permissions
- [ ] Implement real-time collaboration (Socket.io)
- [ ] Add AR preview using WebXR
- [ ] Support multiple garment layers
- [ ] AI-generated texture patterns
- [ ] Animation and physics simulation
- [ ] HDR environment maps for realistic lighting
- [ ] Material library with presets

### Performance Considerations
- Three.js bundle adds ~600KB (gzipped)
- Keep models < 50K triangles for smooth performance
- Textures are cached to avoid reloading
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Responsive and mobile-friendly

### Accessibility
- ✅ Full keyboard navigation
- ✅ ARIA labels on all controls
- ✅ Screen reader support
- ✅ Reduced motion support
- ✅ Focus visible indicators
- ✅ Semantic HTML

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a new feature that doesn't affect existing functionality.

## Related Issues

None - New feature implementation

## Reviewer Notes

- This is a complete feature implementation ready for review
- The PR is marked as DRAFT until real 3D models and textures are added
- Backend storage uses local filesystem - S3 integration is prepared but not implemented
- Voice commands require HTTPS in production (browser security requirement)
- Consider adding this feature to the main navigation menu in a follow-up PR

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
# For S3 storage (not required for MVP)
USE_S3=true
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret

# Server port (optional)
PORT=3001
```

### File Permissions
Ensure the server has write permissions for:
- `packages/server/data/designs/`
- `packages/server/uploads/`

### HTTPS Requirement
Voice commands require HTTPS in production (browser security policy).

**Ready for Review**: Yes, pending addition of actual 3D models and textures for full demonstration.

**Merge Strategy**: Squash and merge recommended to keep history clean.
